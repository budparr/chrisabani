![Chris Headshot](/assets/img/author-photo_chris-abani-c-chris-abani.jpg) Chris Abani's first novel, published when he was 16, was *[Masters of the Board](/book/masters-of-the-board/)*, a political thriller about a foiled Nigerian coup. The story was convincing enough that the Nigerian government threw him in jail for inciting a coincidentally timed real-life coup. Imprisoned and tortured twice more, he channeled the experience into searing poetry. 

Abani's best-selling 2004 novel [*GraceLand*](/book/graceland/) is a searing and funny tale of a young Nigerian boy, an Elvis impersonator who moves through the wide, wild world of Lagos, slipping between pop and traditional cultures, art and crime. It's a perennial book-club pick, a story that brings the postcolonial African experience to vivid life.

Now based in Los Angeles, Abani published [*The Virgin of Flames*](/book/the-virgin-of-flames/) in 2007. He is also a publisher, running the poetry imprint [Black Goat Press](/black-goat-poetry-series/)
