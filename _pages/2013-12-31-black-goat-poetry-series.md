   POETRY SERIES</h3>
    <p><span class="redText"> Black Goat</span> is an independent poetry series imprint created by Chris Abani. It is affiliated with Akashic Books and is currently an imprint of that press. </p>
    <p>The vision behind <span class="redText">Black Goat</span> is simple: a commitment to publishing collections of poetry that might not otherwise find a home. Selected work will represent the finest examples of well-crafted and sometimes challenging poetry, and will also focus on experimental, aesthetically or thematically challenging work. The series also aims to create a proportional representation of African and other non-American as well as female poets on its list. </p>
    <p>The series, established in 2004, will begin by publishing two to four books of poetry over the course of two years. The series-founding editor, Chris Abani, solicits and selects manuscripts for publication in its <span class="redText">Black Goat</span> Poetry Series. No unsolicited manuscripts will be accepted at this time. </p>
    <p>The press is interested both in encouraging emerging talent and in helping to maintain poets in mid-career internationally, and as such, collected or selected Bilingual Poems will also be considered. Each new poet will be introduced by a more established American writer.</p>
