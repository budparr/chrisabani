Tough, spirited and fiercely independent Abigail is brought as a teenager to London from Nigeria by relatives who attempt to force her into prostitution. She flees and in the aftermath struggles to find herself in the shadow of a strong but dead mother and also the means to save the one lover she has chosen in her short life, her social worker; disgraced and now facing charges. In spare yet haunting and lyrical prose reminiscent of Marguerite Duras, Abani brings to life a young woman who lives with a strength and inner light that will enlighten and uplift the reader.
